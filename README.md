# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2024

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

These are my answers and approach to the Advent of Code puzzles for 2024. - Kodebae

I will be using Python for my puzzles.

* Set up a virtual env:
```
python3 -m venv advent_env
source advent_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: advent_env\Scripts\activate
```
